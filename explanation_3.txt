quick sort was used to sort the array input with a time complexity of O(nlogn)
The space complexity is O(n)

After sorting the larger numbers are within an iteration

Quick sort was implemented by picking a pivot (the first element in the list)
Then the array are then sorted recursively by putting lower element to the left of the pivot  and 
higher element to the right of the pivot


After sorting , the list was looped through in reverse order and the numbers were concatenated to 
two values using a flag as a determinant either to ad it to the firstoutput or second output
