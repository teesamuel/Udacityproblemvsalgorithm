Time complexity as intructed O(logn)
Time complexity  O(log n) this is because new array that is half in size are created by each time the recursion occurs 

The implementation recursives devides the array to perform search . 
The recursion has a sorted side and another unsorted side

A while loop was used in this implementation and the list was recursively divide into two parts 
and the element we are looking for are being checked
