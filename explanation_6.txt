Time complexity is O(n) because its performs a single tranversal through the list
Space complexity is O(1)

The first element were picked as the smallest element and also the largest element. 

An iteration was done through the list to check if each element is less than lowest 
or greater than highest and there values are then being replaced if found to meet the check condition.
