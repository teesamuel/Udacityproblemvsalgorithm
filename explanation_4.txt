Time complexity is O(n) 
space complexity is O(1)
The list was looped through and the number were then sorted as required

I used three pointers and looped throught the list.I did swaping when 0 or 2 is encountered
I moved the element to the left and increment the current index when 0 is encountered and move 2 to the 
right side when 2 is encountered and also reduce the last index.

the aim of the swapping was to ensure that the left has zeros , the right has 2 and automatically 1 will be in the middle
